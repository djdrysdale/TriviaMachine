This is a trivia game I created while learning JavaScript on Team Treehouse. 

I had the following goals:

1) Display a random question 
2) Collect the user's answer (text-based, no multiple choice)
3) Check the user's score against a number of possible answers (to account for variations in spelling, phrasing, etc)
4) Keep the user's score
5) Do not repeat questions
6) End the game at 3 incorrect answers
7) Make it look decent

I'd like to continue to build it out by checking the user's responses on the server side, which will probably mean learning NodeJS, but I found that Treehouse course to be quite challenging. I'll come back to it at some point and give it a shot, though.

I'd also like to make it a bit more mobile friendly. It's okay, but not perfect.
